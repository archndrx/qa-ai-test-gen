## Getting Started

First, add env for the base api key: 

add this to your .env.local
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Note :
If you don't want to put your API KEY in the local env, you can directly input it in the Custom API Key column on the frontend according to the provider you choose.
